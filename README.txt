Thesis Title: "Design and Implementation of a Low-Power, High-Performance RISC-V Processor for Edge Computing Applications"

Thesis Information:

Introduction:
This thesis focuses on the design and implementation of a RISC-V based processor, which is a popular and open-source instruction set architecture (ISA). The primary objective is to create a processor tailored for edge computing applications, which demand a balance between high performance and low power consumption. Edge computing refers to processing data locally on devices or edge servers, reducing latency and the need for constant cloud connectivity.

Motivation:
Edge computing is gaining prominence with the proliferation of IoT devices and applications such as autonomous vehicles, smart cities, and wearable technology. These applications require processors that can handle complex tasks efficiently while remaining energy-efficient. Traditional processors designed for data centers are not well-suited for these scenarios due to their power-hungry nature.

Objectives:

Design a RISC-V processor architecture optimized for edge computing workloads.
Implement the processor using hardware description languages such as Verilog or VHDL.
Optimize the processor for low power consumption while maintaining competitive performance.
Evaluate the performance of the designed processor through simulations and, if possible, on real hardware platforms.
Compare the designed processor with existing architectures to showcase its advantages for edge computing.
Methodology:
The project will involve extensive research into RISC-V architecture, particularly focusing on custom extensions and optimizations. The processor will be designed, coded, and simulated using hardware description languages. Power efficiency will be a key consideration during the design process. Evaluation will be carried out through benchmarking and comparison with other processors.

Expected Outcomes:
The thesis is expected to yield a custom RISC-V processor optimized for edge computing, demonstrating significant improvements in power efficiency compared to traditional processors. It may also lead to insights on the design of processors for specific application domains.

Significance:
The outcome of this thesis can contribute to the field of computer engineering by addressing the growing demand for energy-efficient processors in edge computing scenarios. It may find applications in a wide range of industries, from healthcare and automotive to smart home technologies.

This thesis title and information provide a clear direction for a computer engineering student interested in processor design and its application in the context of edge computing.
